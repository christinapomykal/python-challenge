# Python challenge to analyze large datasets

The project requires the analysis of datasets in CSV files using Python scripts. The 2 parts of the project are to analyze financial data and election data. 

## PyBank

The Python script analyzes the financial data of the `Date` and `Profit/Losses` contained in [budget_data.csv](PyBank/Resources/budget_data.csv). 

### PyBank analysis

The PyBank analysis provides a basic picture of the financial health over the time period of the dataset. The Python script writes the financial analysis to the file [Analysis_PyBank.txt](PyBank/Analysis/Analysis_PyBank.txt), and displays results to the terminal. 

* The tasks are to create a Python script to calculate:
  * time period the dataset covers
  * net total `Profit/Losses`
  * average of the changes in `Profit/Losses`
  * date and amount of the greatest increase in profits
  * date and amount of the greatest decrease in losses

## PyPoll

The Python script analyzes the voting data of the `Voter ID`, `County`, and `Candidate` contained in [election_data.csv](PyPoll/Resources/election_data.csv).  

### PyPoll analysis

The analysis for PyPoll provides the election winner along with a breakdown of each candidate who received a vote. The results of the election analysis writes to the file [Analysis_PyPoll.txt](PyPoll/Analysis/Analysis_PyPoll.txt), and displays in the terminal. 

* The tasks are to create a Python script to calculate and analyze:
  * total number of casted votes
  * list of candidates receiving votes
  * for each candidate the percentage and number of votes
  * winner of the election
